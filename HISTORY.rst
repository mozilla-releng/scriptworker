   ``/dev/urandom``, and no longer has hacks to install an old version
   of gpg.

   verification. ``public/chain-of-trust.json.sig`` is mandatory if
   signature verification is on. ``public/chainOfTrust.json.asc`` is no
   longer used.
-  similarly, ``public/chainOfTrust.json.asc`` is no longer generated or
   uploaded by scriptworker.

~~~~~

   of artifacts, preventing duplicate concurrent downloads of the same

   instead of linux64 repackage-signing because linux64 stopped running
   repackage-signing. We also test an esr60 index.

-  ``generate_cot`` now generates up to 3 files:
   ``chainOfTrust.json.asc``, ``chain-of-trust.json``, and
   ``chain-of-trust.json.sig``.
-  ``download_cot`` now also downloads ``chain-of-trust.json`` as an
   optional artifact, and adds ``chain-of-trust.json.sig`` as an
   optional artifact if signature verification is enabled. These will
   become mandatory artifacts in a future release.
-  ``chainOfTrust.json.asc`` is now a mandatory artifact in cot
   verification, but is deprecated. We will remove this artifact in a
   future release.
-  ``verify_cot_signatures`` verifies ed25519, and falls back to gpg. We
   will make ed25519 signature verification mandatory in a future
   release, and remove gpg verification.
-  we now require ``cryptography>=2.6.1`` for ed25519 support.

---------------------

.. _added-21:

Added
~~~~~

-  mobile can create in-tree docker images
-  Chain of Trust is now able to validate the following ``tasks_for``:

   -  github-pull-request (even though pull requests seem risky at
      first, this enables smoother staging releases - à la gecko’s try)
   -  github-push

   ``is_try_or_pull_request``

.. _fixed-22:

Fixed
~~~~~

-  fixed some pytest warnings

.. _section-56:

[16.0.1] - 2018-09-14
---------------------

.. _fixed-23:

Fixed
~~~~~

-  Look for the ``cb_name`` of actions with kind ``task``.

.. _section-57:

[16.0.0] - 2018-09-12
---------------------

.. _added-31:

Added
~~~~~

-  add ``get_action_callback_name``

.. _fixed-24:

Fixed
~~~~~

-  verify actions properly, even if they share the same name with
   another action (``cb_name`` is unique; ``name`` is not).

.. _removed-11:

Removed
~~~~~~~

-  remove ``get_action_name``

.. _section-58:

[15.0.4] - 2018-09-11

Added
~~~~~

-  Allow mozilla-central to update bouncer locations.

.. _section-60:

[15.0.2] - 2018-08-31
---------------------

.. _added-34:

Added
~~~~~

-  Allow any branch access to the -dev bouncer scriptwork.

.. _section-61:

[15.0.1] - 2018-08-31
---------------------

.. _changed-28:

Changed
~~~~~~~

-  use ``task.tags.worker-implementation`` as the worker implementation,
   if specified.

.. _section-62:

[15.0.0] - 2018-07-26
---------------------

.. _changed-29:

Changed
~~~~~~~

-  require py37 to be green
-  support and require taskcluster>=4.0.0 (``taskcluster.aio`` rather
   than ``taskcluster.async``, because ``async`` is a py37 keyword)

.. _section-63:

[14.0.0] - 2018-07-16
---------------------

.. _changed-30:

Changed
~~~~~~~

-  tests that need an event loop are now all ``@pytest.mark.asyncio``
   and/or using the pytest-asyncio ``event_loop`` fixture, rather than
   using the now-removed local ``event_loop`` fixture. This addresses
   our intermittent test failures, though we need additional work (e.g.,
   PR #244)
-  added more test cases around
   ``get_upstream_artifacts_full_paths_per_task_id``, to allow for
   multiple ``upstreamArtifacts`` entries for a single ``taskId``

.. _fixed-26:

Fixed
~~~~~

-  fixed the hang in ``run_task`` – we were waiting for the
   ``max_timeout`` future to exit, which it did after sleeping for
   ``task_max_timeout`` seconds, so every task took the full timeout to
   complete. Now we use ``asyncio.wait(timeout=...)``.
-  fixed the unclosed session warnings in tests

.. _removed-12:

Removed
~~~~~~~

-  removed ``get_future_exception`` after removing its last caller
-  removed ``max_timeout`` after moving timeout handling into
   ``run_task`` via ``asyncio.wait``
-  removed the ``event_loop`` test fixture; this may have conflicted
   with the ``pytest-asyncio`` ``event_loop`` fixture

.. _section-64:

[13.0.0] - 2018-07-04
---------------------

.. _added-35:

Added
~~~~~

-  added ``task_max_timeout_status``, ``reversed_statuses``, and
   ``invalid_reclaim_status`` to ``DEFAULT_CONFIG``
-  added ``get_reversed_statuses`` for config-driven reversed statuses
-  added ``task.kill_pid`` to kill a process tree
-  added ``task.kill_proc`` to kill a subprocess proc
-  added unit and integration tests for user cancel
-  added ``utils.get_future_exception`` to get the status of a single
   future

.. _changed-31:

Changed
~~~~~~~

-  integration tests now require the
   ``queue:cancel-task:test-dummy-scheduler/*`` scope
-  unit tests now run in random order
-  ``max_timeout`` is now an async function with sleeps rather than a
   synchronous function using ``call_later``
-  split ``run_tasks`` into several helper functions
-  all negative exit statuses now log ``Automation Error``

.. _fixed-27:

Fixed
~~~~~

-  task timeouts should result in an ``intermittent-task``, rather than
   a crashed scriptworker
-  we now kill the task on a ``reclaim_task`` result of 409, allowing
   for user cancellation
-  added logging for uncaught exceptions in ``run_tasks``
-  cancelled the ``reclaim_task`` future on task completion
-  pointed docs at the new ``mdc1`` puppet server
-  cot verification now renders the entire template rather than the
   first task

.. _removed-13:

Removed
~~~~~~~

-  ``REVERSED_STATUSES`` is removed, in favor of
   ``get_reversed_statuses``
-  ``task.kill`` has been removed in favor of ``kill_pid`` and
   ``kill_proc``.
-  quieted cot verification a bit by removing some ``log.debug`` lines

.. _section-65:

[12.1.0] - 2018-06-05
---------------------

.. _changed-32:

Changed
~~~~~~~

-  added ``loop_function`` kwarg to ``sync_main`` for testing

.. _fixed-28:

Fixed
~~~~~

-  fixed tests against aiohttp 3.3.0
-  fixed concurrent test intermittent errors

.. _section-66:

[12.0.1] - 2018-05-31
---------------------

.. _fixed-29:

Fixed
~~~~~

-  fixed ``mobile`` ``prebuilt_docker_image_task_types``
-  we now log exceptions rather than printing a traceback to stderr

.. _section-67:

[12.0.0] - 2018-05-29
---------------------

.. _added-36:

Added
~~~~~

-  added a restriction on a.m.o. production scopes.
-  added ``prebuilt_docker_image_task_types``. These are the task types
   that allow non-artifact docker images; if ``None``, all task types
   are allowed.
-  added ``get_in_tree_template``, ``get_action_context_and_template``,
   ``get_jsone_context_and_template`` to help support new action hooks.
-  added ``verify_repo_matches_url`` to stop using ``.startswith()`` to
   compare urls
-  added ``REPO_SCOPE_REGEX`` to allow us to find the ``repo_scope`` in
   a task’s scopes.
-  added ``get_repo_scope`` to return the ``repo_scope`` in a task’s
   scopes (or ``None``)
-  added a ``test/data/cotv3`` dir for action hook test data.

.. _changed-33:

Changed
~~~~~~~

-  set ``cot_version`` to 3.
-  set ``min_cot_version`` to 2.
-  we now require cot artifacts in ``verify_docker_image_sha``.
-  we no longer check docker image shas against an allowlist; they
   either match chain of trust artifact shas, or they’re a task type
   that allows prebuilt docker images. If these are defined in-tree, we
   trace the request to the tree, so these should be as trustable as the
   tree in question.
-  we no longer allow for ignoring decision tasks’ ``taskGroupId``\ s.
   If they differ from the ``taskId``, we follow the chain back.
-  we no longer skip ``verify_docker_worker_task`` for ``mobile``
   ``cot_product``; but we do allow for prebuilt docker images on all
   task types.
-  ``get_source_url`` now throws a ``CoTError`` if both the source url
   and repo are defined, and the source url doesn’t match the repo.
-  quieted the test output significantly.
-  default test verbosity is toggled on by the
   ``SCRIPTWORKER_VERBOSE_TESTS`` env var.
-  by default, tests now run concurrently for faster results. To allow
   this, we no longer close the event loop anywhere.

.. _fixed-30:

Fixed
~~~~~

-  we now log the exception at bad git tag signature verification.

.. _removed-14:

Removed
~~~~~~~

-  removed cotv1 support
-  removed ``docker_image_allowlists``
-  removed ``gecko-decision`` from the decision ``workerType``\ s
-  removed ``ACTION_MACH_COMMANDS`` and ``DECISION_MACH_COMMANDS``
-  removed “fuzzy matching” task definitions in ``task-graph.json``.
   With json-e enabled actions, we should be able to match the
   ``taskId`` exactly.
-  removed ``verify_decision_command``; rebuilding the task definition
   via json-e is more precise.
-  removed ``get_jsone_template`` in favor of the other, more specific
   template functions.

.. _fixed-31:

Fixed
~~~~~

-  added ``.pytest_cache`` to ``.gitignore``

.. _section-68:

[11.1.0] - 2018-05-16
---------------------

.. _added-37:

Added
~~~~~

-  added py37 testing. This is currently broken due to ``ldna_ssl`` and
   ``PyYAML``; marked this test in ``allow_failures``.
-  Support for ``mobile`` projects and more precisely Firefox Focus

.. _section-69:

[11.0.0] - 2018-05-10
---------------------

.. _changed-34:

Changed
~~~~~~~

   `#135 <https://github.com/mozilla-releng/scriptworker/issues/135>`__

.. _removed-16:

~~~~~

-  added support for bouncer scriptworker

.. _changed-39:

Changed
~~~~~~~

-  renamed ``run_loop`` to ``run_tasks``
-  ``run_tasks`` now shuts down gracefully after receiving a SIGTERM: it
   finishes the current task(s), and exits.

.. _fixed-36:

Fixed
~~~~~

-  ``run_tasks`` now sleeps 5 if there were no tasks claimed.

.. _section-80:

[8.1.1] - 2018-02-13
--------------------

.. _fixed-37:

Fixed
~~~~~

-  Freeze aiohttp to 2.x.y

.. _section-81:

[8.1.0] - 2018-01-31
--------------------

.. _added-45:

Added
~~~~~

-  ``valid_vcs_rules``, ``source_env_prefix``,
   ``extra_run_task_arguments`` depend on ``cot_product``
-  ``cot_product`` is defined in example configuration
-  Support for ship-it tasks

.. _section-82:

[8.0.0] - 2018-01-19
--------------------

.. _added-46:

Added
~~~~~

-  Added ``scriptworker.cot.verify.get_jsone_template``, because action
   tasks use actions.json instead of .taskcluster.yml

.. _changed-40:

Changed
~~~~~~~

-  Added a ``tasks_for`` argument to ``populate_jsone_context``.
-  Used ``format_json`` instead of ``pprint.pformat`` in most
   ``scriptworker.cot.verify`` functions.

.. _removed-17:

Removed
~~~~~~~

-  Removed ``scriptworker.utils.render_jsone``, since it reduced to a
   ``jsone.render`` call.
-  Removed the now-unused
   ``scriptworker.constants.max_jsone_iterations``

.. _section-83:

[7.0.0] - 2018-01-18
--------------------

.. _added-47:

Added
~~~~~

-  Added ``scriptworker.cot.verify.verify_parent_task_definition``. This
   is the core change in this release, aka CoT version 2. We now use
   json-e to rebuild the decision/action task definitions from the tree.
-  Added ``json-e`` and ``dictdiffer`` dependencies.
-  ``arrow``, ``certifi``, ``multidict``, ``taskcluster``, and ``yarl``
   have updated their major version numbers.
-  Added ``Context.projects`` and ``Context.populate_projects``.
-  Added ``load_json_or_yaml_from_url``.
-  Added ``DEFAULT_CONFIG['cot_version']`` and
   ``DEFAULT_CONFIG['min_cot_version']``; this is cotv2. If
   ``min_cot_version`` is 1, we allow for falling back to the old cot v1
   logic.
-  Added ``DEFAULT_CONFIG['project_configuration_url']`` and
   ``DEFAULT_CONFIG['pushlog_url']``.
-  Added ``scriptworker.task.KNOWN_TASKS_FOR``,
   ``scriptworker.task.get_action_name``,
   ``scriptworker.task.get_commit_message``,
   ``scriptworker.task.get_and_check_project``,
   ``scriptworker.task.get_and_check_tasks_for``
-  Added ``scriptworker.utils.remove_empty_keys`` since the taskgraph
   drops key/value pairs where the value is empty. See
   https://github.com/taskcluster/json-e/issues/223
-  Added ``scriptworker.utils.render_jsone`` to generically render
   json-e.
-  Added ``max_jsone_iterations`` pref; sometimes the values to replace
   template values are several layers deep.
-  Added ``scriptworker.cot.verify.get_pushlog_info``,
   ``scriptworker.cot.verify.get_scm_level``,
   ``scriptworker.cot.verify.populate_jsone_context``, and
   ``scriptworker.cot.verify.compare_jsone_task_definition``.
-  Added test files to ``scriptworker/test/data/cotv2/``.

.. _changed-41:

Changed
~~~~~~~

-  Renamed ``load_json`` to ``load_json_or_yaml``. This now takes a
   ``file_type`` kwarg that defaults to ``json``.
-  Moved ``get_repo``, ``get_revision``, ``is_try``, and ``is_action``
   from ``scriptworker.cot.verify`` to ``scriptworker.task``
-  Moved the sub-function path callback from ``scriptworker.cot.verify``
   to ``scriptworker.utils.match_url_path_callback``
-  ``scriptworker.cot.verify.guess_task_type`` takes a 2nd arg,
   ``task_defn``, to differentiate action tasks from decision/cron
   tasks.
-  ``scriptworker.cot.verify.get_all_artifacts_per_task_id`` adds
   ``public/actions.json`` and ``public/parameters.yml`` to decision
   task artifacts to download, for action task verification.
-  Removed the ``firefox`` from ``scriptworker.cot.verify`` function
   names.
-  Tweaked the task ID logging in ``verify_cot``.

.. _fixed-38:

Fixed
~~~~~

-  Updated ``path_regexes`` to identify most (all?) valid hg.m.o repo
   paths, instead of returning ``None``.

.. _removed-18:

Removed
~~~~~~~

-  Removed ``scriptworker.cot.verify.verify_decision_task`` and
   ``scriptworker.cot.verify.verify_action_task`` in favor of
   ``scriptworker.cot.verify.verify_parent_task``.

.. _section-84:

[6.0.2] - 2018-01-17
--------------------

.. _added-48:

Added
~~~~~

-  ``max_chain_length`` pref, defaulting to the arbitrary (but larger
   than the current 5) int 20.

.. _changed-42:

Changed
~~~~~~~

-  Stopped hardcoding the max chain length to 5 due to longer-than-5
   valid chains in production.

.. _section-85:

[6.0.1] - 2018-01-03
--------------------

.. _added-49:

Added
~~~~~

[6.0.0] - 2018-01-03
--------------------

.. _added-50:

Added
~~~~~

-  ``scriptworker.cot.verify.download_cot`` now supports optional
   upstream artifacts
-  ``scriptworker.artifacts.get_optional_artifacts_per_task_id``,
   ``scriptworker.cot.verify.(is_task_required_by_any_mandatory_artifact, is_artifact_optional)``,
   and
   ``scriptworker.utils.(get_results_and_future_exceptions, add_enumerable_item_to_dict)``
   are defined and publicly exposed.

.. _changed-43:

Changed
~~~~~~~

-  ``scriptworker.artifacts.get_upstream_artifacts_full_paths_per_task_id``
   returns 2 dictionaries instead of 1.
-  ``scriptworker.cot.verify.(verify_docker_image_sha, download_cot_artifact)``
   don’t error out if cot isn’t defined (missing cot are detected
   earlier)

.. _section-87:

[5.2.3] - 2017-10-20
--------------------

.. _fixed-39:

Fixed
~~~~~

-  Made the exit status more explicit on exit code -11.
-  Fixed ``verify_sig`` to return the message body if ``gpg.decrypt``
   returns an empty body.

.. _section-88:

[5.2.2] - 2017-10-16
--------------------

.. _added-51:

Added
~~~~~

-  Added integration tests that run ``verify_chain_of_trust`` against
   production tasks, to make sure ``cot.verify`` changes are backwards
   compatible.

.. _fixed-40:

Fixed
~~~~~

-  stopped verifying docker-worker cot on the chain object, which may
   not have a cot artifact to verify.
-  updated the ``retry_exceptions`` for ``retry_request`` to include
   ``asyncio.TimeoutError``.

.. _removed-19:

Removed
~~~~~~~

-  Removed the ``await asyncio.sleep(1)`` after running a task.

.. _section-89:

[5.2.1] - 2017-10-11
--------------------

.. _added-52:

Added
~~~~~

-  scriptworker will now retry (``intermittent-task`` status) on a
   script exit code of -11, which corresponds to a python segfault.

.. _section-90:

[5.2.0] - 2017-10-03
--------------------

.. _added-53:

Added
~~~~~

-  ``scriptworker.task.get_parent_task_id`` to support the new
   ``task.extra.parent`` breadcrumb.
-  ``scriptworker.cot.verify.ACTION_MACH_COMMANDS`` and
   ``cot.verify.PARENT_TASK_TYPES`` to separate action task verification
   from decision task verification.
-  ``scriptworker.cot.verify.ChainOfTrust.parent_task_id`` to find the
   ``parent_task_id`` later.
-  ``scriptworker.cot.verify.LinkOfTrust.parent_task_id`` to find the
   ``parent_task_id`` later.
-  added a new ``action`` task type. This uses the same sha allowlist as
   the ``decision`` task type.
-  ``scriptworker.cot.verify.is_action``, since differentiating between
   a decision task and an action task requires some task definition
   introspection.
-  ``verify_firefox_decision_command`` now takes a ``mach_commands``
   kwarg; for action tasks, we set this to ``ACTION_MACH_COMMANDS``
-  ``verify_action_task`` verifies the action task command.
-  ``verify_parent_task`` runs the checks previously in
   ``verify_decision_task``; we run this for both action and decision
   tasks.

.. _changed-44:

Changed
~~~~~~~

-  ``find_sorted_task_dependencies`` now uses the ``parent_task_id``
   rather than the ``decision_task_id`` for its ``parent_tuple``.
-  ``download_firefox_cot_artifacts`` now downloads ``task-graph.json``
   from action tasks as well as decision tasks
-  ``verify_decision_task`` now only checks the command. The other
   checks have been moved to ``verify_parent_task``.
-  decision tasks now run ``verify_parent_task``.

.. _fixed-41:

Fixed
~~~~~

-  Updated ``README.md`` to specify ``tox`` rather than
   ``python setup.py test``

.. _section-91:

[5.1.5] - 2017-10-02
--------------------

.. _added-54:

Added
~~~~~

-  added maple to the list of privileged branches.

.. _changed-45:

Changed
~~~~~~~

-  changed the default ``poll_interval`` to 10.

.. _fixed-42:

Fixed
~~~~~

-  updated post-task sleep to 1; we only sleep ``poll_interval`` only
   between polls.

.. _removed-20:

Removed
~~~~~~~

-  removed date from the list of privileged branches.

.. _section-92:

[5.1.4] - 2017-09-06
--------------------

.. _fixed-43:

Fixed
~~~~~

-  no longer add a decision task’s decision task to the chain of trust
   to verify. This was a regression.

.. _removed-21:

Removed
~~~~~~~

-  cleaned up aurora references from everything but pushapk, which uses
   it.

.. _section-93:

[5.1.3] - 2017-09-01
--------------------

.. _fixed-44:

Fixed
~~~~~

-  specify the correct docker shas for the new docker images.

.. _section-94:

[5.1.2] - 2017-09-01
--------------------

.. _fixed-45:

Fixed
~~~~~

-  fixed new false error raised on missing command in payload

.. _section-95:

[5.1.1] - 2017-08-31
--------------------

.. _fixed-46:

Fixed
~~~~~

-  updated cot verification to allow for the new docker-image and
   decision paths (/home/worker -> /builds/worker)

.. _section-96:

[5.1.0] - 2017-08-31
--------------------

.. _added-55:

Added
~~~~~

-  added ``DECISION_MACH_COMMANDS`` to ``cot.verify``, to support action
   task verification
-  added ``DECISION_TASK_TYPES`` to ``cot.verify``, to support verifying
   decision tasks via ``verify_cot``
-  added ``ChainOfTrust.is_decision`` to find if the chain object is a
   decision task
-  added ``ChainOfTrust.get_all_links_in_chain``. Previously, we ran
   certain tests against all the links in the chain, and other tests
   against all links + the chain object. Now, the chain itself may be a
   decision task; we will add the decision task as a link in the chain,
   and we no longer want to run verification tests against the chain
   object.
-  added new docker image shas

.. _changed-46:

Changed
~~~~~~~

-  we now support testing any verifiable ``taskType`` via
   ``verify_cot``! Previously, only scriptworker task types were
   verifiable via the commandline tool.
-  we now support testing action task commandlines in
   ``verify_firefox_decision_command``
-  we no longer ignore the decision task if the task-to-verify is the
   decision task in ``find_sorted_task_dependencies``. We want to make
   sure we verify it.
-  we no longer raise a ``CoTError`` if the ``ChainOfTrust`` object is
   not a scriptworker implementation

.. _fixed-47:

Fixed
~~~~~

-  fixed ``partials`` task verification

.. _section-97:

[5.0.2] - 2017-08-28
--------------------

.. _added-56:

Added
~~~~~

-  added .json as an ``ignore_suffix`` for docker-worker
-  added ``partials`` as a valid task type

.. _section-98:

[5.0.1] - 2017-08-25
--------------------

.. _added-57:

Added
~~~~~

-  added sparse checkout decision task support in cot verification.
-  added decision image 0.1.10 sha to allowlist

.. _section-99:

[5.0.0] - 2017-08-22
--------------------

.. _added-58:

Added
~~~~~

-  ``watch_log_file`` pref, to watch the log file for ``logrotate.d``
   (or other) rotation. Set this to true in production.

.. _changed-47:

Changed
~~~~~~~

-  switched from ``RotatingFileHandler`` to ``WatchedFileHandler`` or
   ``FileHandler``, depending on whether ``watch_log_file`` is set.

.. _removed-22:

Removed
~~~~~~~

-  Non-backwards-compatible: removed ``log_max_bytes`` and
   ``log_num_backups`` prefs. If set in a config file, this will break
   scriptworker launch. I don’t believe anything sets these, but bumping
   the major version in case.

.. _removed-23:

Removed
~~~~~~~

.. _section-100:

[4.2.0] - 2017-08-21
--------------------

.. _added-59:

Added
~~~~~

-  added ``prepare_to_run_task`` to create a new
   ``current_task_info.json`` in ``work_dir`` for easier debugging.

.. _changed-48:

Changed
~~~~~~~

-  ``.diff`` files now upload as ``text/plain``.

.. _section-101:

[4.1.4] - 2017-08-16
--------------------

.. _changed-49:

Changed
~~~~~~~

-  updated the decision + docker-image ``workerType``\ s

.. _fixed-48:

Fixed
~~~~~

-  closed the contextual log handler to avoid filling up disk with open
   filehandles

.. _section-102:

[4.1.3] - 2017-07-13
--------------------

.. _added-60:

Added
~~~~~

-  added a check to verify the cot ``taskId`` matches the task
   ``taskId``
-  added a a ``claimWork`` debug log message
-  added a check to prevent ``python setup.py register`` and
   ``python setup.py upload``

.. _fixed-49:

Fixed
~~~~~

-  updated the docs to more accurately reflect the new instance steps
-  updated the docs to avoid using
   ``python setup.py register sdist upload``
-  allowed the decision task to be an additional runtime dep

.. _section-103:

[4.1.2] - 2017-06-14
--------------------

.. _changed-50:

Changed
~~~~~~~

-  rewrote chain of trust docs.

.. _fixed-50:

Fixed
~~~~~

-  fixed artifact list verification in ``task.payload`` for
   generic-worker tasks.

.. _removed-24:

Removed
~~~~~~~

-  removed old format balrog scope.

.. _section-104:

[4.1.1] - 2017-05-31
--------------------

.. _added-61:

Added
~~~~~

-  added ``.sh`` as an ``ignore_suffix`` for generic-worker

.. _section-105:

[4.1.0] - 2017-05-31
--------------------

.. _added-62:

Added
~~~~~

-  added generic-worker chain of trust support
-  ``scriptworker.cot.verify.verify_generic_worker_task``, currently
   noop

.. _changed-51:

Changed
~~~~~~~

-  generic-worker ``ignore_suffixes`` now includes ``.in``

.. _section-106:

[4.0.1] - 2017-05-23
--------------------

.. _changed-52:

Changed
~~~~~~~

-  Updated Google Play scopes to allow Nightly to ship to the Aurora
   product

.. _section-107:

[4.0.0] - 2017-05-15
--------------------

.. _added-63:

Added
~~~~~

-  added ``scriptworker.task.claim_work`` to use the ``claimWork``
   endpoint instead of polling.

.. _changed-53:

Changed
~~~~~~~

-  changed ``worker.run_loop`` to use the new ``claim_work`` function.
   In theory this can handle multiple tasks serially, but in practice
   should only get one at a time. In the future we can allow for
   multiple tasks run in parallel in separate ``work_dir``\ s, if
   desired.
-  ``worker.run_loop`` now always sleeps the ``poll_interval``. We can
   adjust this if desired.

.. _fixed-51:

Fixed
~~~~~

-  tweaked docstrings to pass pydocstyle>=2.0

.. _removed-25:

Removed
~~~~~~~

-  removed ``Context.poll_task_urls``
-  removed ``scriptworker.poll`` completely

.. _section-108:

[3.1.2] - 2017-04-14
--------------------

.. _changed-54:

Changed
~~~~~~~

-  allowed for retriggering tasks with a subset of
   ``task.dependencies``, specifically to get around expiration of the
   breakpoint dependency of pushapk tasks.

.. _section-109:

[3.1.1] - 2017-04-07
--------------------

.. _added-64:

Added
~~~~~

-  added oak to ``all-nightly-branches``, for update testing.
-  added ``repackage`` as a valid, verifiable task type for cot.

.. _section-110:

[3.1.0] - 2017-04-05
--------------------

.. _added-65:

Added
~~~~~

-  added log message on startup.

.. _changed-55:

Changed
~~~~~~~

-  updated docker image allowlists
-  changed balrog nightly branches to ``all-nightly-branches``

.. _section-111:

[3.0.0] - 2017-03-23
--------------------

.. _added-66:

Added
-----

-  ``scriptworker.artifacts`` now has new functions to deal with
   ``upstreamArtifacts``:
   ``get_upstream_artifacts_full_paths_per_task_id``,
   ``get_and_check_single_upstream_artifact_full_path``, and
   ``get_single_upstream_artifact_full_path``.
-  added a ``LinkOfTrust.get_artifact_full_path`` method
-  new ``helper_scripts`` directory: ``gpg_helper.sh`` is a wrapper to
   call gpg against a given gpg home directory. ``create_gpg_keys.py``
   is a script to create new scriptworker gpg keys.

.. _changed-56:

Changed
-------

-  updated support, and now require, ``aiohttp>=2.0.0``
-  pointed the pushapk scopes at new ``betatest`` and ``auroratest``
   ``cot_restricted_trees`` aliases
-  renamed ``find_task_dependencies`` to
   ``find_sorted_task_dependencies``

.. _fixed-52:

Fixed
-----

-  ``aiohttp`` 2.0.0 no longer burns travis jobs.

.. _section-112:

[2.6.0] - 2017-03-06
--------------------

.. _changed-57:

Changed
~~~~~~~

-  update balrog restricted scopes to include
   ``project:releng:balrog:nightly`` until we’re done with it

.. _section-113:

[2.5.0] - 2017-03-06
--------------------

.. _changed-58:

Changed
~~~~~~~

-  allow for ``/bin/bash`` in decision task command line

.. _fixed-53:

Fixed
~~~~~

-  don’t add a decision task’s decision task to the dependency chain. In
   2.2.0 we stopped verifying that a decision task was part of its
   decision task’s task graph, but still verified the decision task’s
   decision task (if any). This release stops tracing back to the
   original decision task altogether.

.. _section-114:

[2.4.0] - 2017-02-28
--------------------

.. _changed-59:

Changed
~~~~~~~

-  updated balrog restricted scopes

.. _section-115:

[2.3.0] - 2017-02-22
--------------------

.. _changed-60:

~~~~~~~

-  updated balrog and beetmover restricted scopes

.. _section-116:

[2.2.0] - 2017-02-15
--------------------

.. _changed-61:

Changed
~~~~~~~

-  decision tasks are no longer traced back to decision tasks, even if
   their ``taskGroupId`` doesn’t match their ``taskId``.

.. _fixed-54:

Fixed
~~~~~

-  tests now pass under python 3.6; we’ll update the supported version
   list when taskcluster-client.py has full py36 support
-  fixed closed event loop errors from the new aiohttp
-  git tests now use a local git repo tarball, instead of running tests
   on the scriptworker repo

.. _removed-26:

Removed
~~~~~~~

-  removed the check for max number of decision tasks per graph

.. _section-117:

[2.1.1] - 2017-02-02
--------------------

.. _fixed-55:

Fixed
~~~~~

-  ``get_artifact_url`` now works with ``taskcluster==1.0.2``, while
   keeping 0.3.x compatibility
-  more verbose upload status

.. _section-118:

[2.1.0] - 2017-01-31
--------------------

.. _added-67:

Added
~~~~~

-  ``intermittent-task`` status
-  ``scriptworker.utils.calculate_sleep_time``
-  added ``retry_async_kwargs`` kwarg to ``retry_request``
-  added ``sleeptime_kwargs`` kwarg to ``retry_async``

.. _changed-62:

Changed
~~~~~~~

-  renamed ``release`` and ``nightly`` branch aliases to
   ``all-release-branches`` and ``all-nightly-branches``
-  updated pushapk restricted scopes
-  reduced ``aiohttp_max_connections`` to 15
-  ``aiohttp`` exceptions now result in an ``intermittent-task`` status,
   rather than ``resource-unavailable``

.. _section-119:

[2.0.0] - 2017-01-25
--------------------

.. _added-68:

Added
~~~~~

-  ``scriptworker.artifacts`` is a new submodule that defines artifact
   behavior
-  we now support ``pushapk`` scriptworker instance types in
   ``cot.verify``

.. _changed-63:

Changed
~~~~~~~

-  ``freeze_values`` is now ``get_frozen_copy``, and now returns a
   frozen copy instead of modifying the object in place.
-  ``unfreeze_values`` is now ``get_unfrozen_copy``
-  ``check_config`` now calls ``get_frozen_copy`` on the ``config``
   before comparing against ``DEFAULT_CONFIG``
-  ``create_config`` calls ``get_unfrozen_copy``, resulting in a
   recursively frozen config
-  ``DEFAULT_CONFIG`` now uses ``frozendict``\ s and ``tuple``\ s in
   nested config items.
-  ``.asc`` files are now forced to ``text/plain``
-  all ``text/plain`` artifacts are now gzipped, including .log, .asc,
   .json, .html, .xml
-  we no longer have ``task_output.log`` and ``task_error.log``.
   Instead, we have ``live_backing.log``, for more
   treeherder-friendliness

.. _removed-27:

Removed
~~~~~~~

-  stop testing for task environment variables. This is fragile and
   provides little benefit; let’s push on `bug
   1328719 <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1328719>`__
   instead.

[1.0.0b7] - 2017-01-18
----------------------

.. _added-69:

Added
~~~~~

-  ``unfreeze_values``, to unfreeze a ``freeze_values`` frozendict.

.. _changed-64:

Changed
~~~~~~~

-  ``freeze_values`` now recurses.

.. _fixed-56:

Fixed
~~~~~

-  delete azure queue entries on status code 409 (already claimed or
   cancelled). This allows us to clean up cancelled tasks from the
   queue, speeding up future polling.
-  more retries and catches in ``find_task``, making it more robust.

[1.0.0b6] - 2017-01-12
----------------------

.. _fixed-57:

Fixed
~~~~~

-  balrog tasks are now verifiable in chain of trust.

[1.0.0b5] - 2017-01-10
----------------------

.. _added-70:

Added
~~~~~

-  ``verify_signed_tag``, which verifies the tag’s signature and makes
   sure we’re updated to it.

.. _changed-65:

Changed
~~~~~~~

-  ``rebuild_gpg_homedirs`` now uses git tags instead of checking for
   signed commits.
-  ``get_git_revision`` now takes a ``ref`` kwarg; it finds the revision
   for that ref (e.g., tag, branch).
-  ``update_signed_git_repo`` ``revision`` kwarg is now named ``ref``.
   It also verifies and updates to the signed git tag instead of
   ``ref``.
-  ``update_signed_git_repo`` now returns a tuple (revision, tag)
-  ``build_gpg_homedirs_from_repo`` now uses ``verify_signed_tag``
   instead of ``verify_signed_git_commit``, and takes a new ``tag`` arg.

.. _fixed-58:

Fixed
~~~~~

-  the curl command in ``Dockerfile.gnupg`` now retries on failure.

.. _removed-28:

Removed
~~~~~~~

-  ``verify_signed_git_commit_output``
-  ``verify_signed_git_commit``

[1.0.0b4] - 2016-12-19
----------------------

.. _added-71:

Added
~~~~~

-  beetmover and balrog scriptworker support in chain of trust
   verification
-  ``cot_restricted_trees`` config, which maps branch-nick to branches

.. _changed-66:

Changed
~~~~~~~

-  Changed ``cot_restricted_scopes`` to be a scope to branch-nick dict,
   indexed by ``cot_product``

.. _fixed-59:

Fixed
~~~~~

-  nuke then move the tmp gpg homedir, rather than trying to [wrongly]
   use ``overwrite_gpg_home`` on a parent dir

[1.0.0b3] - 2016-12-07
----------------------

.. _added-72:

Added
~~~~~

-  Dockerfiles: one for general testing and one for gpg homedir testing,
   with readme updates
-  ``flake8_docstrings`` in tox.ini
-  log chain of trust verification more verbosely, since we no longer
   have real artifacts uploaded alongside

.. _changed-67:

Changed
~~~~~~~

-  download cot artifacts into ``work_dir/cot`` instead of
   ``artifact_dir/public/cot``, to avoid massive storage dups
-  ``download_artifacts`` now returns a list of full paths instead of
   relative paths. Since ``upstreamArtifacts`` contains the relative
   paths, this should be more helpful.
-  ``contextual_log_handler`` now takes a ``logging.Formatter`` kwarg
   rather than a log format string.

.. _changed-68:

Changed
~~~~~~~

-  check for a new gpg homedir before ``run_loop``, because puppet will
   now use ``rebuild_gpg_homedirs``

.. _fixed-60:

Fixed
~~~~~

-  updated all docstrings to pass ``flake8_docstrings``
-  switched to a three-phase lockfile for gpg homedir creation to avoid
   race conditions (locked, ready, unlocked)
-  catch ``aiohttp.errors.DisconnectedError`` and
   ``aiohttp.errors.ClientError`` in ``run_loop`` during
   ``upload_artifacts``
-  compare the built docker-image tarball hash against
   ``imageArtifactHash``

.. _removed-29:

Removed
~~~~~~~

-  the ``create_initial_gpg_homedirs`` entry point has been removed in
   favor of ``rebuild_gpg_homedirs``.

[1.0.0b2] - 2016-11-28
----------------------

.. _changed-69:

Changed
~~~~~~~

-  ``scriptworker.cot.verify.raise_on_errors`` now takes a kwarg of
   ``level``, which defaults to ``logging.CRITICAL``. This is to support
   fuzzy task matching, where not matching a task is non-critical.
-  ``scriptworker.cot.verify.verify_link_in_task_graph`` now supports
   fuzzy task matching. If the Link’s ``task_id`` isn’t in the task
   graph, try to match the task definition against the task graph
   definitions, and throw ``CoTError`` on failure. This is to support
   Taskcluster retriggers.
-  ``verify_cot`` is now an entry point, rather than a helper script in
   ``scriptworker/test/data/``.

.. _fixed-61:

Fixed
~~~~~

-  allowed for ``USE_SCCACHE`` as a build env var

[1.0.0b1] - 2016-11-14
----------------------

.. _added-73:

Added
~~~~~

-  ``scriptworker.cot.verify`` now verifies the chain of trust for the
   graph.
-  ``scriptworker.exceptions.CoTError`` now marks chain of trust
   validation errors.
-  ``scriptworker.task.get_task_id``, ``scriptworker.task.get_run_id``,
   ``scriptworker.task.get_decision_task_id``,
   ``scriptworker.task.get_worker_type``
-  ``scriptworker.log.contextual_log_handler`` for short-term logs
-  added framework for new docs

.. _changed-70:

Changed
~~~~~~~

-  config files are now yaml, to enable comments.
   ``config_example.json`` and ``cot_config_example.json`` have been
   consolidated into ``scriptworker.yaml.tmpl``. ``context.cot_config``
   items now live in ``context.config``.
-  ``validate_artifact_url`` now takes a list of dictionaries as rules,
   leading to more configurable url checking.
-  ``scriptworker.cot`` is now ``scriptworker.cot.generate``. The
   ``get_environment`` function has been renamed to
   ``get_cot_environment``.
-  ``scriptworker.gpg.get_body`` now takes a ``verify_sig`` kwarg.
-  ``download_artifacts`` now takes ``valid_artifact_task_ids`` as a
   kwarg.
-  ``max_connections`` is now ``aiohttp_max_connections``
-  scriptworker task definitions now expect an ``upstreamArtifacts``
   list of dictionaries

.. _fixed-62:

Fixed
~~~~~

-  docstring single backticks are now double backticks
-  catch aiohttp exceptions on upload

.. _removed-30:

Removed
~~~~~~~

-  removed all references to ``cot_config``
-  removed the credential update, since puppet restarts scriptworker on
   config change.

.. _section-120:

[0.9.0] - 2016-11-01
--------------------

.. _added-74:

Added
~~~~~

-  ``gpg_lockfile`` and ``last_good_git_revision_file`` in config
-  ``get_last_good_git_revision`` and ``write_last_good_git_revision``
   now return the last good git revision, and write it to
   ``last_good_git_revision_file``, respectively.
-  ``get_tmp_base_gpg_home_dir`` is a helper function to avoid
   duplication in logic.
-  ``rebuild_gpg_homedirs`` is a new entry point script that allows us
   to recreate the gpg homedirs in a tmpdir, in a separate process
-  ``is_lockfile_present``, ``create_lockfile``, and ``rm_lockfile`` as
   helper functions for the two gpg homedir entry points.

.. _changed-71:

Changed
~~~~~~~

-  ``sign_key``, ``rebuild_gpg_home_flat``, ``rebuild_gpg_home_signed``,
   ``build_gpg_homedirs_from_repo`` are no longer async.
-  ``overwrite_gpg_home`` only keeps one backup.
-  ``update_signed_git_repo`` now returns the latest git revision,
   instead of a boolean marking whether the revision is new or not. This
   will help avoid the scenario where we update, fail to generate the
   gpg homedirs, and then stay on an old revision until the next push.
-  ``update_logging_config`` now takes a ``file_name`` kwarg, which
   allows us to create new log files for the ``rebuild_gpg_homedirs``
   and ``create_initial_gpg_homedirs`` entry points.

.. _fixed-63:

Fixed
~~~~~

-  ``build_gpg_homedirs_from_repo`` now waits to verify the contents of
   the updated git repo before nuking the previous base gpg homedir.
-  ``create_initial_gpg_homedirs`` now creates a logfile

.. _removed-31:

Removed
~~~~~~~

-  ``rebuild_gpg_homedirs_loop`` is no longer needed, and is removed.

.. _section-121:

[0.8.2] - 2016-10-24
--------------------

.. _changed-72:

Changed
~~~~~~~

-  logged the stacktrace if the ``main`` loop hits an exception. No
   longer catch and ignore ``RuntimeError``, since it wasn’t clear why
   that was put in.
-  updated ``check_config`` to make sure taskcluster-related configs
   match taskcluster requirements

.. _fixed-64:

Fixed
~~~~~

-  changed the way the polling loop works: ``async_main`` is now a
   single pass, which ``main`` calls in a ``while True`` loop. This
   should fix the situation where polling was dying silently while the
   git update loop continued running every 5 minutes.

.. _section-122:

[0.8.1] - 2016-10-18
--------------------

.. _fixed-65:

Fixed
~~~~~

-  explicitly pass ``taskId`` and ``runId`` to ``claim_task``. There’s a
   new ``hintId`` property that appears in ``message_info['task_info']``
   that broke things.

.. _section-123:

[0.8.0] - 2016-10-13
--------------------

.. _added-75:

Added
~~~~~

-  added ``git_key_repo_dir``, ``base_gpg_home_dir``, ``my_email``, and
   ``gpg_path`` to ``config_example.json``
-  added ``cot_config_example.json``, ``cot_config_schema.json``, and
   ``scriptworker.config.get_cot_config`` for ChainOfTrust config
-  added ``update_signed_git_repo``, ``verify_signed_git_commit``,
   ``build_gpg_homedirs_from_repo``, ``rebuild_gpg_homedirs_loop``, and
   ``create_initial_gpg_homedirs`` for gpg homedir creation and updates
   in the background.
-  added a background call to update the gpg homedirs in
   ``scriptworker.worker.async_main``
-  added another entry point, ``create_initial_gpg_homedirs``, for
   puppet to create the first gpg homedirs

.. _changed-73:

Changed
~~~~~~~

-  default config filename is now ``scriptworker.json`` instead of
   ``config.json``
-  moved ``scriptworker.config.get_context_from_cmdln`` out of
   ``scriptworker.worker.main``; now using argparse
-  changed default ``sign_chain_of_trust`` to True
-  ``scriptworker.gpg.sign_key``,
   ``scriptworker.gpg.rebuild_gpg_home_flat``, and
   ``scriptworker.gpg.rebuild_gpg_home_signed`` are now async, so they
   can happen in parallel in the background
-  renamed ``scriptworker.gpg.latest_signed_git_commit`` to
   ``scriptworker.gpg.verify_signed_git_commit_output``
-  combined ``scriptworker.log.log_errors`` and
   ``scriptworker.log.read_stdout`` into
   ``scriptworker.log.pipe_to_log``
-  added ``taskGroupId`` to the list of default valid ``taskId``\ s to
   download from. This logic will need to change in version 0.9.0 due to
   the new `chain of trust dependency traversal
   logic <https://gist.github.com/escapewindow/a6a6944f51d4219d08284ededc65aa30>`__

.. _fixed-66:

Fixed
~~~~~

-  added missing docstrings to the ``download_artifacts`` and
   ``download_file`` functions
-  fixed coverage version in ``tox.ini py35-coveralls``
-  ``sign_key`` now supports signing keys with multiple subkeys

.. _section-124:

[0.7.0] - 2016-09-23
--------------------

.. _added-76:

Added
~~~~~

-  added ``DownloadError`` exception for ``download_file``
-  added ``scriptworker.task.download_artifacts``
-  added ``scriptworker.util.download_file``

.. _changed-74:

Changed
~~~~~~~

-  ``DEFAULT_CONFIG``, ``STATUSES``, and ``REVERSED_STATUSES`` have
   moved to ``scriptworker.constants``.
-  ``list_to_tuple`` has been renamed ``freeze_values``, and also
   converts dict values to frozendicts.

.. _section-125:

[0.6.0] - 2016-09-15
--------------------

.. _added-77:

Added
~~~~~

-  significant gpg support
-  ability to create new gpg homedirs
-  scriptworker now requires ``pexpect`` for gpg key signing
-  docstrings!
-  helper scripts to generate 1000 pubkeys and time importing them.
-  added ``scriptworker.utils.rm`` as an ``rm -rf`` function

.. _changed-75:

Changed
~~~~~~~

-  ``utils.makedirs`` now throws ``ScriptWorkerException`` if the path
   exists and is not a directory or a softlink pointing to a directory.
-  gpg functions now take a ``gpg_home`` kwarg to specify a different
   homedir
-  moved ``scriptworker.client.integration_create_task_payload`` into
   ``scriptworker.test``
-  renamed ``scriptworker.util.get-_hash`` kwarg ``hash_type`` to
   ``hash_alg``
-  renamed ``firefox_cot_schema.json`` to ``cot_v1_schema.json``; also,
   the schema has changed.
-  the chain of trust schema has changed to version 1.

.. _fixed-67:

Fixed
~~~~~

-  pass a ``task`` to ``scriptworker.task.reclaimTask`` and exit the
   loop if it doesn’t match ``context.task``
-  we now verify that ``context.task`` is the same task we scheduled
   ``reclaim_task`` for.

.. _removed-32:

Removed
~~~~~~~

-  Removed ``get_temp_creds_from_file``, since we’re not writing
   ``temp_creds`` to disk anymore
-  Removed ``scriptworker.task.get_temp_queue``, since we already have
   ``context.temp_queue``
-  Removed ``pytest-asyncio`` dependency. It doesn’t play well with
   ``pytest-xdist``.
-  Removed ``scriptworker.task.get_temp_queue``; we can use
   ``context.temp_queue``
-  Removed ``pytest-asyncio`` usage to try to use ``pytest-xdist``, then
   turned that back off when it conflicted with the event loop

   (``internal-error``); ``ScriptWorkerRetryException`` now has an
   ``exit_code`` of 4 (``resource-unavailable``)
